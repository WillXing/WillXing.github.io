Defer keyword in go is a delayed execution, it will only execute once the surrounding function returns.

## Example

```go
func main() {
  defer fmt.Print("Function executed!")
  fmt.Print("Function do stuff")
}
// Out put like:
// Function do suff
// Function executed
```

## Multiple Defer

Deferred statement are all put in to the `stack`, meaning: when surrounding function return, all defer will executed by revese order.

## Usage

I can't think about much usage of the defer, I think one use case might be when want to do something after the function actually finished successfully.

And if you want to execute some function base on another functions result, using defer can put this invoking chain inside function without return to the main.
