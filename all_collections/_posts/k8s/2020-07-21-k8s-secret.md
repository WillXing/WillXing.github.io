Secret resource in kubernetes is use to manage the secret value in the cluster.

## Create secret

Create sercret is the same like create config, can create from file or literal, if want to create with yaml, just need to make sure the value is encoded with `base64`.

## Use secret

Use secret is also same like [use `configMap` value]({% post_url k8s/2020-07-19-three-way-to-use-config-map-in-pod %}).

But just:
- instead of use `configMapKeyRef`, use `secretKeyRef`
- instead of use `configMapRef`, use `secretRef`


## Get secret value

Firstly can get the encoded value by 

```bash
kubectl get secret mysecret -o yaml
```

Then the value will come with base64 encoded, so just decode with base64 will get the value: `echo ${encoded_value} | base64 -d`
