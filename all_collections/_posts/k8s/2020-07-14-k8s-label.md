## Equal Selector

`==` or `!=` are the equal type selector

- For CLI command: `kubectl get pods -l environment=production`
- For API: `?labelSelector=environment%3Dproduction`
- For YAML: 
  ```yaml
  selector:
    environment: production
  ```

## Set Selector

Keyword `in`

- For CLI command: `kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (production, qa)`
- For API: `?labelSelector=environment+in+%28production%2Cqa%29`
- For YAML: 
  ```yaml
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: environment, operator: In, values: [production, qa]}
  ```

Note, the set selector in config file now only support by some relatively new resources: `Job`, `Deployment`, `Replica Set`, `Daemon Set`
