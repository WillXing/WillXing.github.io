The jobs in k8s I think it's just a way to manage [pods]({% post_url k8s/2020-07-10-k8s-pods %}) which aiming at doing certain temporary tasks.

So in my mind, those task should be: stateless, can be interrupt at any point.

## How jobs run

When create a job, the job is actually scheduling pods to execute some command or maybe just run some image.

## Completions

When set the `spec.completions` of a job, it will make sure pods can complete the job at times equal to the value in this field.

## Parallelism

When no value set to `spec.parallelism` of a job, the defaul value is 1, which means in anytime, there is only 1 pod running. If you set to 2, then it's means allow 2 pods running for this job parallel.
