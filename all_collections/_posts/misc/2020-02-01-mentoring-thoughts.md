## What is and Why Mentoring

Every tech company when some new dude on board, they usually will assign some old dude to look after the new one. This relationship is called in different name like partnership, sponsorship, buddy-ship, mentorship, personally I feels they are the same. I'll just call it mentor ship now.

They just describing a special relationship between two or more people, and usually:

1. The one being mentored are more likely to have less experience of working.

2. The one being mentored are more likely to have less understanding of the projects team working on.

3. The one being are more likely to know less about the company (policy, politics...).

As you can see, there are gaps, gaps are a great tool or material for mentor ship.

The mentoring system not build for fill the gap, the purpose is for *help people learn and grow their career, also grow people to meet the requirement of team and company*.

It's already sounds very good for mentee, but not just that, it's also a good thing for mentor. It's can grow the mentor in the same time. We know mentor people is good for the organisation, it logically make mentoring an important skill to build, the good organisation saw the benefit of mentoring also makes mentoring skill an important matrix when promoting employee.

## My mentoring retrospective

1. Every mentee are different, you can't use the previous experience to define your current mentee.
  - The first mentee I have in my life, he's really super self driving, and it's make the mentoring so easy, I just tell him what we need to do in the following months, then he make up goals and made his plan. What I need just to regular catch up with him, and help him with all the difficulties he had, I don't need to worry or try hard to understand what he need at the time, cause I know he will just come to me.
  - Mistake I made is I treat everyone the same, the second one I got he's quite not self-driving, and maybe not really feels comfortable to reach out others for help. I still don't want to try too hard to understand him, or help him to make goals and plans, my excuse is "I don't want to babysitting him", but it's wrong, firstly, that's not babysitting, he just need me to change the way to communicate, secondly, help him to sort out the goal and make plan is one of my job as a mentor.

2. Can build friendship during mentorship, but it's not the purpose.
  - It's not essential to be a friend to your mentee, cause that's always not the purpose. It's sounds cold, but the things really matter in this relationship is helping people to grow.
  - There are many things in friendship sounds like benefit for mentoring, but those benefit just not only can bring by friendship, you can also have them, but the problem that mix the friendship here is quite bad.
  - Personally, I found it's not easy to do the tough talk when friendship it's there. I am not good at set boundary, and it's blur the boundary even more.

3. Leave more specific problem to the mentee, but not leave them the whole big problem.
  - Not everyone born with the ability to break down the problem into small pieces.
