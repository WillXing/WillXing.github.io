Java have some atomic type which consider as `CAS`. Implement by `Unsage` type.

What it's basic means is when the thread try change some variable, it will do the following step:

1. Set expected value as the current value of the variable

2. Compare if the current value is same with expected value

3. If
   
   1. It's equal to the expected value, assign the new value to it.
   2. It's not equal to the expected value, do nothing

Step 2 & 3 are the `CAS` operation, and it's atomic.

## Problem

### ABA Problem

When a value changed from A to B then to A again, the `CAS` operation will think it's not changed.

### Loop

The `CAS` operation usually come with loop statement. It will try do the operation couple times, set expected value do `CAS`...

So it might will have performance issue.
