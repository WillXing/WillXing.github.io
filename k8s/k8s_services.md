# Kubernetes services

An abstract layer use to expose services from pods to cluster internal or external.

When use `ClusterIP` type to expose service, it's only available for cluster internal.

## Base on deployment

When exposing service, it's expose the [[k8s_deployments]]

```sh
kubectl expose deployment/$DEPLOYMENT_NAME --type="ClusterIP/NodePort/ExternalName..."
```

## Use label

Service use label to select a group of [[k8s_pods]]
When expose a deployment, it will use deployment's automatically generated label.

## Delete service

```sh
kubectl delete service -l labelkey=labelvalue
# eg. run=kubernetes-bootcamp
```
